Polkadot is a heterogeneous multichain with shared security and interoperability.

## Relay Chain

The Relay Chain is the central chain of Polkadot. All validators of Polkadot are staked on the Relay
Chain in DOT and validate for the Relay Chain. The Relay Chain is composed of a relatively small
number of transaction types that include ways to interact with the governance mechanism, parachain
auctions, and participating in NPoS. The Relay Chain has deliberately minimal functionality - for
instance, smart contracts are not supported. The main responsibility is to coordinate the system as
a whole, including parachains. Other specific work is delegated to the parachains, which have
differing implementations and features.

## [Parachains](build-deploy-parachains) and [Parathreads](learn-parathreads)

Most of the computation that happens across the Polkadot network as a whole will be delegated to
specific parachain implementations that handle various use cases. Polkadot places no constraints
over what parachains are able to do besides that they must be able to generate a proof that can be
validated by the validators assigned to the parachain. This proof verifies the state transition of
the parachain. Some parachains may be specific to a particular application, others may focus on
specific features like smart contracts, privacy or scalability -- still others might be
experimental architectures that are not necessarily blockchain in nature.

In order to remain connected to the Relay Chain, parachains must win a
[parachain slot auction](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction) to secure a slot for a
particular length of time. Parathreads do not remain connected, but must win auctions for individual
blocks. There is thus an economic difference between parathreads and parachains. Parachains will
have to bond a large up-front deposit for the right to connect to the Relay Chain; parathreads will
pay on a per-block basis. Parathreads can become parachains, and vice-versa.

## Shared Security

Parachains connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain all share in the security of the Relay Chain.
Polkadot has a shared state between the Relay Chain and all of the connected parachains. If the
Relay Chain must revert for any reason, then all of the parachains would also revert. This is to
ensure that the validity of the entire system can persist and no individual part is corruptible.

The shared state makes it so that the trust assumptions when using Polkadot parachains are only
those of the Relay Chain validator set, and no other. Since the validator set on the Relay Chain is
expected to be secure with a large amount of stake put up to back it, it is desirable for parachains
to benefit from this security.

## Roles

### Validators

Validators, if elected to the validator set, produce blocks on the Relay Chain. They also accept
proofs of valid state transition from collators. In return, they will receive staking rewards.

### Collators

Collators are full nodes on both a parachain and the Relay Chain. They collect parachain
transactions and produce state transition proofs for the validators on the Relay Chain. They can
also send and receive messages from other parachains using XCMP.

### Nominators

Nominators bond their stake to particular validators in order to help them get into the active
validator set and thus produce blocks for the chain. In return, nominators are generally rewarded
with the portion of the staking rewards from that validator.
